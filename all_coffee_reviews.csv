After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation.

After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation.
